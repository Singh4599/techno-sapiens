# ðŸš€ Complete Setup Guide

## âœ… What's Fixed:

1. **Admin Role-Based Access** - Only admins can access `/admin`
2. **Dashboard Integration** - Shows user registrations from Supabase
3. **Admin Registration Manager** - Shows ALL registrations with user/event details
4. **RLS Policies** - Proper database security
5. **React Types** - Fixed build issues

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:

### 1. **Database Setup (Supabase)**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open your project: `dbbqkvncvpghhqaroxav`
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy content from: `database/ADMIN_SETUP.sql`
5. **Run** the SQL

### 2. **Make Yourself Admin**
After running the SQL, run this query:
```sql
-- Get your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Add yourself as admin (replace with your actual user_id)
INSERT INTO public.admin_users (user_id, email)
VALUES ('your-user-id-here', 'your-email@example.com');
```

### 3. **Test Your Site**
1. **Login** with your account
2. **Go to `/admin`** - Should work if you're admin
3. **Register for events** - Should show in dashboard
4. **Check admin page** - Should show all registrations
